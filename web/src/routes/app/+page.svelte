            A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a host machine. A fake hypervisor built using VirtualBox can simulate the behavior of a real hypervisor by allowing users to create and manage multiple VMs on a single physical machine. This can be useful for testing and development purposes, or for creating isolated environments for running applications or services. With a fake hypervisor, users can install and run multiple operating systems on their computer without having to worry about compatibility issues or hardware constraints. VirtualBox provides a user-friendly interface for creating, configuring, and managing VMs, making it an accessible and convenient choice for building a fake hypervisor.
